Task Summary: 1905509010845843052

Work Performed:
1. Initial Linting and Formatting:
   - Ran ESLint and Prettier.
   - Fixed a `no-case-declarations` error in `src/viewmodels/uiViewModel.js`.
   - Formatted multiple files.
   - Some `no-unused-vars` and `no-prototype-builtins` warnings remained as per ESLint config, some `no-prototype-builtins` were fixed.

2. README.md Update:
   - Updated the "Project Structure" section to reflect the MVVM architecture.
   - Corrected paths and names for configuration files.
   - Ensured script descriptions and core features were accurate.

3. Commented out Firebase Functionality:
   - The entire content of `src/firebase.js` was commented out to ensure it's non-operational.
   - Verified that `src/main.js` and `src/session_management.js` had no active imports from `firebase.js`.

Known Issues / Incomplete Steps:
- Environmental Instability: Persistent timeouts were encountered when running npm scripts (`npm run lint`, `npm run dev`, `npm run build`).
- ESLint after Firebase changes: Due to the timeouts, could not run ESLint to check for new warnings after commenting out Firebase.
- Documentation Update for Firebase: The `docs/` folder update was planned but not completed for reflecting the Firebase commenting out, due to prioritizing submission because of environment issues.

Next Steps (User Request):
- Submit current changes for manual testing and further investigation of environment issues in a new task.
